# Furnished-plans-to-vector-plan
After the machine trained to generate a furnished plan, the author scripted the image to vector algorithm to convert the color furnished plan into a vector file.
It has four steps:
1-The machine generate a Furnished plan
2-ALgorithm convert the color furnished plan into 3d and 4d matrix
3-through .csv, this file converted into a rhino-grasshopper
4-through python inside grasshopper, the numerical data converts to vector furniture
 -->this repository provided just the algorithm of step 2
